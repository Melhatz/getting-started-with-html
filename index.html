  <!--Hi! I have been learning coding on the job while working in ecommerce and want to expand my knowledge. Some notes will be for my reference and act as a way for me to add my own context, so sorry if they are confusing.-->

<!-- The <head> element contents will not be shown on the web page. It can contain titles- required in all html docs, metadata and in some cases is where tracking scripts are added for tools like Google Analitics.The title tag in the header allows the page title to show up on the browser tab to the right of the favicon and can help with SEO.--> 
<!-- The body of the html document contains the content that is displyed on the page for users to see or interact with. It uses tags like heading 1 <h1>, emphasis <em>, and strong emphasis <strong> to tell the computer how to show the content on the web page. -->
<h1>Important Concepts</h1>
<br>
<h2>Basic Web Info</h2>
<p>The web is a collection of html documents stored on servers around the world. When a user connects to the web using a browser like Google Chrome, the browser uses HTTP, or Hypertext Tranfer Protocol, to connect to servers and display webpages at the userâ€™s request.  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4185478836/e-48230539/m-48742046"> This video </a>  contains an expanded but simple explanation.</p>
<!--In some CMS programs h2 is labeled as the subtitle-->
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is the most common type of file found on the web. HTML documents are made of:<br><li>Text Content- What you see on the page</li>
  <li>Mark Up Or Styling- How the content looks on the page</li>
  <li>Refrences to other documents on the web- examples: Video, Audio or Image files</li>
  <li>Links to other html pages on the web</li>
</p>
<br>
<h2>HTML Mark Up</h2>
<p>Tags, Elements, and Attributes are used by programmers in HTML documents to tell the computer how to display the content on the web page. 
  <br>This graphic shows the components of a tag:<br>

<br>Some tags like line breaks do not have closures. In  <a

<br>
<h2>Computers are Simple Creatures</h2>
<p>Computers are straightforward in the way they read HTML. They do not give context, so code must be carfully written or kitties may die.<br>

<br>
<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
<p>Elements can be broken down in to 2 types:<br>
 <em>Inline:</em> Elements that flow in text content and will follow white space settings.<br>
  <strong>OR</strong><br>
  <em>Block:</em> Elements that create invisable blocks around content that can have special padding and margins.</p>
<br>
<h2>HTML Documents</h2>
<p>HTML documents have a head and body area. The head contains the title and styling information. The body contains the page content that is to be displayed to the user.
